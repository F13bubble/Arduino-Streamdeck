# Arduino-Streamdeck - What is even that?
Together with a buddy, I built this streamdeck. The functions of the buttons were all hard-coded back then - and it worked great!
But that was a while ago...
Now it was time to give the whole thing a ✨user-friendly✨ upgrade.

My idea: The user should be able to easily customize the button assignments via software - and the Streamdeck (or the Arduino behind it) saves everything locally. No more fiddling around in the code. 😊👍
