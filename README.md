# Arduino-Streamdeck - What is even that?
Together with a buddy, I built this streamdeck. The functions of the buttons were all hard-coded back then - and it worked great!
But that was a while ago...
Now it was time to give the whole thing a ‚ú®user-friendly‚ú® upgrade.

My idea: The user should be able to easily customize the button assignments via software - and the Streamdeck (or the Arduino behind it) saves everything locally. No more fiddling around in the code. üòäüëç

  <summary>But first a short overfiew of the streamdeck itself:</summary>

  ### <strong> (You can the full instruction on [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/HyperDeck-an-Arduino-Streamdeck/)) </strong>



### Used Parts
- Arduino Pro Micro (5V)
- 12 Switches/buttons (I used "CS Matcha Green Switch" from AKKO)
- (optional) led strip as backlight (cut to 3 leds)


### Circuit diagram

### Case
The design of the case is completely up to you :)
BUT I recommend a white filament for the backplate of the buttons to let the light through (if you want it glowing).
